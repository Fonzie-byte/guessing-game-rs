## Strategy tips
- Too high = Take the average between the last guess and the highest guess so far or 100; fill in the nearest integer of that number.
- Too low = Take the average between the last guess and the lowest guess so far or 0; fill in the nearest integer of that number.

### Following along with the first example run:

| # | Result          |      Calc optimal next move |
|--:|-----------------|----------------------------:|
| 1 | 50 is too low!  |           `(50+100)÷2 = 75` |
| 2 | 75 is too high! |          `(50+75)÷2 = 62.5` |
| 3 | 63 is too high! |       `(50+62.5)÷2 = 56.25` |
| 4 | 56 is too low!  |   `(56.25+62.5)÷2 = 59.375` |
| 5 | 59 is too low!  | `(59.375+62.5)÷2 = 60.9375` |
